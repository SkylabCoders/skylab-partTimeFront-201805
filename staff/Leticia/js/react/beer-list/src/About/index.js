      <p>Have you ever wanted to search through Brewdog's expansive back catalogue of beer in a programmatic way? Maybe build a tool that pairs beer with food, or search beers with an abv of more than 4%? Well now your prayers have been answered!</p>
      <p>The Punk API takes Brewdog's DIY Dog and turns it into a searchable, filterable API that's completely free and open source.</p>
      <h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>
      <p>The data in this API is taken directly from BrewDogâ€™s DIY Dog and is therefore free to use, replicate verbatim and share, but cannot be used for commercial purposes. If you have an enquiry about DIY Dog, contact hello@brewdog.com.</p>
